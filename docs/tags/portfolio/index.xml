&lt;p&gt;For our digital company greeting card this holiday, I took some already created environments and mashed them together into this. And yes, just to be über-clear, it was all done with V-Ray for Maya with some Nuke comping on top. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wilson tennis ball</title><link>https://markholloway.com/blog/2012/10/29/wilson-tennis-ball/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://markholloway.com/blog/2012/10/29/wilson-tennis-ball/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A personal weekend project. Everything created from scratch in 3D and completed within the same day (that rarely happens these days&amp;hellip;). It feels good to be back! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Maya viewport screengrab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with a 24x12 sphere, extracted parts of it which I then rotated and welded back in place. This caused a symmetric and natural flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kenny Begins</title><link>https://markholloway.com/blog/2009/12/10/kenny-begins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://markholloway.com/blog/2009/12/10/kenny-begins/</guid><description>&lt;div class="video-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleven years after the successful TV series “Kenny Starfighter”, galaxy hero Kenny returns in “Kenny Begins”. The ambitions of the film, shot with the Red One camera, was to become the biggest feature film of the action comedy genre ever made in Sweden, sporting more than 600 visual effects shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work on this project started early on with script breakdown (into VFX shots) followed by on-set VFX supervision and previz as well as look development of the fully-3D sequences. After having been on-set the serious work started to get all shots done in time. I primarily worked with animation, shading, lighting, rendering in Maya and compositing in Nuke throughout the project together with the excellent team at Filmgate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Digital visual effects showreel 2008</title><link>https://markholloway.com/blog/2008/12/25/digital-visual-effects-showreel-2008/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://markholloway.com/blog/2008/12/25/digital-visual-effects-showreel-2008/</guid><description>&lt;div class="video-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a showcase of some assorted hands-on work done by me at




&lt;a href="https://www.filmgate.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Filmgate&lt;/a&gt;.
Besides working on the graphics (and generally running the company with my
co-founders), I was responsible for script breakdowns and on-set supervision
for many feature film productions. A full list of productions can be seen over
at 



&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1972642/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the later productions before leaving Filmgate in 2009 is unfortunately
not included in the showreel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.filmgate.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Filmgate&lt;/a&gt;, I assisted 



&lt;a href="https://www.bobby.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bobby&lt;/a&gt; in completing two 3D “Eurosize” ad board prints: “Ramlösa Kaktus” and “Ramlösa Persimon &amp;amp; Grape”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first encounter with V-Ray (for 3D Studio Max) in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Island of Lost Souls</title><link>https://markholloway.com/blog/2007/02/10/island-of-lost-souls/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://markholloway.com/blog/2007/02/10/island-of-lost-souls/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;



&lt;a href="https://www.filmgate.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Filmgate&lt;/a&gt; were offered the opportunity by Ghost A/S to work, as sub-contractors, on this exciting Zentropa production which at the time was the largest visual effects movie to be made in Scandinavia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work for Filmgate involved working on 457 shots out of 627 which consisted of compositing, roto, matte paintings, set extensions and various small 3D work. On this project I primarily worked with green screen keying and compositing in Nuke as well as minor 3D work in Maya.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pistvakt</title><link>https://markholloway.com/blog/2005/10/10/pistvakt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://markholloway.com/blog/2005/10/10/pistvakt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of my very first feature film visual effects projects, where I primarily performed compositing and blue screen keying in Shake as well as some minor 3D work in Maya while working at Farmland, Trollhättan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was, at the time, the largest blue screen production to have been made in Scandinavia.&lt;/p&gt;
