ISO The hardware is only capable of maximum ISO 1600. Any higher ISO value is pushed with software in camera. ISO value also serves as lowest ISO value allowed when Auto ISO is on. Auto-ISO can be set to a maximum ISO value between 400 - 3200. When shooting RAW (with Auto-ISO turned off), ISO can be set to a minimum of 200 and a maximum of 6400. When shooting in JPG mode (with Auto-ISO turned off), ISO can be set to a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 12800. When in Auto-ISO, the “Min shutter” value will not be respected if you hit the Max ISO value. The Min shutter value could therefore be regarded as a “soft limit” Min shutter value. Dynamic range (tone mapping) DR100 is the default setting for the camera. DR200 (changes minimum ISO to 400) will stop down the RAW 1 stop. DR400 (changes minimum ISO to 800) will stop down the RAW 2 stops. RAW files with DR200 or DR400 will appear darker in post production as they are stopped down, and there is currently no way for e.g. Lightroom to interpret this feature in order to compensate (the way the JPG engine does). Dynamic range is really only good if you use the camera’s JPG engine. If you shoot RAW only, you should set this to DR100 and tweak exposure in post production. Auto focus The X100 uses Contrast Detection Auto Focus (CD AF), which means you should never try to find focus at the edge between two objects of different distance from the camera. More details by Arjay on this over at the X100 Forum. The X100 is not a true rangefinder camera, thus is not great at manual focus. For best AF performance, use AF-S with smallest AF window in Electrical View Finder (EVF). The X100 will have more difficulty locking AF onto horizontal lines than on vertical lines. The AFL/AEL button is by default set to Auto Exposure Lock (AE-L), by setting this to AF-L, auto focus can be locked instead. Optical View Finder (OVF) Power Save Mode set to “on” will reduce AF performance, according to the manual. AF-C is reportedly increasing chances of an AF lock in dim-lit situations. Lens characteristics Prime f/2.0 23mm, equivalent to 35mm on a 35mm camera. The lens is at its sharpest at f/4-f/5.6 and is very, very soft at f/2. For high depth-of-field, f/11 is a good compromise but at f/16 effects of diffraction increases. Built in ND filter (equivalent f-stop reduction of 3).

This could be the result of high shutter speeds and it is recommended to not use a shutter that is faster than somewhere in the 1/250s. Instead, use a narrower aperture size and lower the ISO if necessary. Unfortunately, the built-in ND filter cannot be used in panorama mode. Also, since exposure is locked throughout the 120°/180° sweep, there will be banding if the lighting situation changes. Avoid pointing the camera at the sun and use a lens hood (or a step down adapter ring).</p><h2 id=other-x100-resources>Other X100 resources</h2><p>Make sure to check out some of my other X100 articles:</p><ul><li><a href=../2012/06/12/the-fujifilm-x100-a-year-in-retrospect/>Fujifilm Finepix X100 – a year in retrospect</a></li><li><a href=../2012/08/04/fujifilm-finepix-x100-raw-and-film-simulation/>Fujifilm Finepix X100 – RAW and film simulation</a></li><li><a href=../2012/08/09/fujifilm-finepix-x100-lcd-evf-observations/>Fujifilm Finepix X100 – LCD/EVF observations</a></li></ul></main><div id=giscus-container class=giscus-comments><div class=load-comments-wrapper><button id=load-comments-btn class=load-comments-btn>Load Comments</button></div></div><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("giscus-container"),t=document.getElementById("load-comments-btn");function o(){if(!e)return;e.innerHTML="";const n=document.body.classList.contains("dark")?"dark":"light",t=document.createElement("script");t.src="https://giscus.app/client.js",t.setAttribute("data-repo","fredrikaverpil/fredrikaverpil.github.io"),t.setAttribute("data-repo-id","MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzEwNDU4Njc="),t.setAttribute("data-category","General"),t.setAttribute("data-category-id","DIC_kwDOB8-Z684CU9zc"),t.setAttribute("data-mapping","title"),t.setAttribute("data-strict","0"),t.setAttribute("data-reactions-enabled","1"),t.setAttribute("data-emit-metadata","0"),t.setAttribute("data-input-position","bottom"),t.setAttribute("data-theme",n),t.setAttribute("data-lang","en"),t.setAttribute("crossorigin","anonymous"),t.async=!0,e.appendChild(t)}t&&t.addEventListener("click",o);function n(e){const t=document.querySelector("iframe.giscus-frame");t&&t.contentWindow&&t.contentWindow.postMessage({giscus:{setConfig:{theme:e}}},"https://giscus.app")}const s=document.getElementById("theme-toggle");s&&s.addEventListener("click",()=>{setTimeout(()=>{const e=document.body.classList.contains("dark")?"dark":"light";n(e)},10)}),window.matchMedia&&window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").addEventListener("change",e=>{if(!localStorage.getItem("theme")){const t=e.matches?"dark":"light";n(t)}})})()</script><footer><div class=footer-content><span class=footer-icons><a href=https://github.com/markholloway target=_blank rel=noopener title=GitHub><svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="1.2em" height="1.2em" fill="currentColor"><path d="M12 .297c-6.63.0-12 5.373-12 12 0 5.303 3.438 9.8 8.205 11.385.6.113.82-.258.82-.577.0-.285-.01-1.04-.015-2.04-3.338.724-4.042-1.61-4.042-1.61C4.422 18.07 3.633 17.7 3.633 17.7c-1.087-.744.084-.729.084-.729 1.205.084 1.838 1.236 1.838 1.236 1.07 1.835 2.809 1.305 3.495.998.108-.776.417-1.305.76-1.605-2.665-.3-5.466-1.332-5.466-5.93.0-1.31.465-2.38 1.235-3.22-.135-.303-.54-1.523.105-3.176.0.0 1.005-.322 3.3 1.23.96-.267 1.98-.399 3-.405 1.02.006 2.04.138 3 .405 2.28-1.552 3.285-1.23 3.285-1.23.645 1.653.24 2.873.12 3.176.765.84 1.23 1.91 1.23 3.22.0 4.61-2.805 5.625-5.475 5.92.42.36.81 1.096.81 2.22.0 1.606-.015 2.896-.015 3.286.0.315.21.69.825.57C20.565 22.092 24 17.592 24 12.297c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12"/></svg>
