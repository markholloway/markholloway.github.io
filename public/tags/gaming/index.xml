&lt;p&gt;There are situations where the TV loses a packet every 20-30 pings. On each
packet loss, Remote Play hangs for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disconnecting the HDMI cable between the TV and the PS5 is a workaround for the
problem. This prevents any potential interference between the TV&amp;rsquo;s HDMI-CEC
control signals and the PS5&amp;rsquo;s network communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sony BRAVIA TVs, you can permanently fix this issue by enabling the &amp;ldquo;Simple
IP Protocol&amp;rdquo; under network settings. The Simple IP Protocol reduces network
complexity and overhead by using a more basic communication method, which helps
minimize packet loss and network latency between the TV and the console. This
does come at a cost, which is higher energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
