## Blog Info

After completing a project in Ruby I inadvertantly discovered a more fun and exciting way of blogging with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It provides a lightweight, blog-aware static site that translates plain text to web pages using markdown files, tags, and css. I'm using the [Hyde]({{ site.hyde_repo }}) theme (v{{ site.hyde_version }}) for [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and publish to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). I run Jeckyll with Ruby 2.5 locally in macOS to manage the site before using git to publish new posts or site changes publicly. I'm using the [`dracula.css`](https://github.com/dracula/pygments) theme for [Rougue](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), a Syntax Highlighter written in Ruby.
