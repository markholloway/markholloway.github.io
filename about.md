I began my career back in 1997, fresh out of Cisco's CCNA studies, and quickly developed a passion for IP networking technologies. In 2004 I started working with SIP and VoIP communications for a Service Provider and before long focused primarily on [Acme Packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Packet) and [Broadsoft](https://www.broadsoft.com) technologies. With a background in Cisco Routing and Switching, and in 2010 earning my CCIE in Voice, I merged skills and worked as a Solutions Architect supporting Service Provider and Enterprise customers deploying SIP at the core and edge of their networks.  I've expanded my skills to include Python, which I rely on for everything that is programmable or has an API, such as real-time Voice, SMS, and SIP communications, or SDN, NetDevOps, and Programmability.

I started this blog as a place holder for my technical notes.  I had a difficult time finding resources on the internet for SIP related technologies specific to Service Provider and large Enterprise VoIP architectures. I knew that if I write my notes on paper they would get lost, so I created a blog for my own personal storage of information. I soon realized this is a superior method and I would no longer invest in spiral bound notebooks. I began receiving messages from others who work with similar technologies and found the information to be useful for them.
