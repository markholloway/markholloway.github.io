Hello there, friends! My name is Mark and I am a Solutions Architect based in Atlanta, Georgia. I am also CCIE #27384, as well as holding a number of other industry certifications. I’m currently working for a global communications provider allowing developers to integrate channels of communication into a variety of applications and services using Web APIs, SIP, and programmable Wireless 4G/LTE, EUICC, and Narrowband, running on top of a global network.  I have a keen interest in SDN, network automation, and programmability with Python. Troubleshooting and problem solving are some of my favored past times.

I started my career back in 1997, fresh out of Cisco's CCNA studies. It was in 2004 that I was first introduced to Acme Packet, Broadsoft, and the world of carrier SIP, VoIP, and the very early days of what would become WebRTC. Combined with my background in Cisco Routing and Switching, and later earning my CCIE in Voice, I’ve been hooked on all-things realted to carrier networking and IP  communications, with a particular interest in the service provider core, where the largest, most complex, and reidiculously expensive networks in the world are at my fingertips.
