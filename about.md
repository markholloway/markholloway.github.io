Hi there! My name is Mark and I’m a Solutions Architect based in Atlanta, Georgia. I am CCIE #27384, as well as holding a number of other industry certifications. I’m currently working for a Cloud Communications provider focusing on Programmable APIs for IP communications technologies such as Voice, SMS, Wireless, and Video. I also have a keen interest in network automation and programmability with Python. Troubleshooting and problem solving are some of my favoured past times.

I started my career back in 1997, fresh out of CCNA (beta) studies. It was in 2004 that I was first introduced to Acme Packet, Broadsoft, and the world of SIP and VoIP! Combined with a background in Routing and Switching, I’ve been hooked on carrier grade networking and IP communications with a particular interest in the Service Provider core.
