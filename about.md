Ahoy,  and thanks for visiting! My name is Mark and I am a Solutions Architect for [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com) and I'm based in Atlanta. I am also CCIE #27384, and hold many other industry certifications. I have spent my career working in the domain of Enterprise and Service Provider Voice over IP,  SIP,  Network Routing and Switching, and Wireless LTE, EUICC, and Narrowband. I have a keen interest in Python and after playing 50 levels of [TwilioQuest](http://twilio.com/quest) and completing several missions, Python has become a significant part of my workflow.

I started this blog in 2009 as a place holder for my technical notes.  I had a difficult time finding resources on the Internet for SIP related technologies specific to Service Provider and large Enterprise VoIP deployments. I knew that if I write my notes on paper they would get lost, so I created a WordPress blog for my own personal storage of information. I soon realized this is a superior method to store notes and I would no longer invest in spiral bound notebooks. I started receiving messages from others who work with similar technologies and found the information is useful for them as well. After a long break, in 2019 I decided it was time to ramp things up again and migrated platforms from WordPress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which I find more agile and developer friendly, and moved my domain and hosting to Github Pages.
