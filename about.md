I started this blog as a place holder for my technical notes in 2009.  I had a difficult time finding resources on the Internet for SIP related technologies specific to Service Provider and large Enterprise VoIP deployments. I knew that if I write my notes on paper they would get lost, so I created a blog for my own personal storage of information. I started receiving messages from people who work with similar technologies that found the information to be useful. I continue to write about my technical experiences and hope others find the information interesting and beneficial.
