## Blog Info

After completing a project in Ruby I inadvertantly discovered a fun and exciting way of blogging with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).  I'm using the [Hyde]({{ site.hyde_repo }}) theme (v{{ site.hyde_version }}) for [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and publish to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). I run Ruby and Jekyll locally in macOS to manage the site before using git to publish new posts or site changes. I'm using the [`dracula.css`](https://github.com/dracula/pygments) theme for [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) which is an excellent Syntax Highlighter created in Ruby. 

I have provided the source code [here]({{ site.github.repo }}).
